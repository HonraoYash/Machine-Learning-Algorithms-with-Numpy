# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-with-Numpy
This repository contains all the basic algorithms coded from scratch using Numpy. These are some of the basic algorithms that are asked in ML Coding interviews.

I also provide with a dummy data set for training and testing which you can use for training and testing these models. But I would also recommend creating random data using numpy.
